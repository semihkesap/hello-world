# hello-world
My kind of repository


Hello! I like cyber security and started to learn python. Hoping to grow my skills in security related fields.
Also,I am into dark humor but sometimes I don't get them,so once I understand the joke it gets better.
I can always talk about food,because I was born into one of the greatest food culture.
(I like chopin btw,and pianos,and people who can sing and play pianos,I think you get the idea)
